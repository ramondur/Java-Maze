# Java-Maze

This report is documenting my project for Basic Programming. The project consists of a maze like game where the player tries to get from the starting point to the end point of the maze in as few moves as possible. The player moves through the maze using the arrow keys on the keyboard. When the player reaches the end point, his results are written to a ‘High Score’ file. In particular, this game has a Christmas theme. There are keys and hammers, false and breakable walls and doors in the maze.
