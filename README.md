# Java-Maze

This java program was developed as a final project for the class of Basic Programming in the Master of Bioinformatics at KU Leuven. Shortly, this program is able to read files with information about the maze and generate that same maze in the console and let the user navigate it. There are keys and hammers, false and breakable walls and doors in the maze.
